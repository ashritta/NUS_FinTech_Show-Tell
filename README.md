<h3>Caesar Cipher</h3>

A simple Caesar Cipher app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher that encrypts your message by rotating the letters with a pre-determined shift, for example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 

This app lets you try out a Caesar Cipher to encrypt your messages, using either:
<br>1. A fixed shift of 13 characters (ROT13), or
<br>2. A custom user-specified shift.

3. Send an automated Telegram message informing me of any commits - telegram.yml

<h3>What didn't go so well?</h3>
1. Telegram Bot - Chat ID retrieval from Telegram API initially failed with error code 404. The bot had to be initialised with a message before chat ID could be retrieved.

2. JS functions with repeated functionality - I started off with making sure the ROT13 function works correctly, to get the app up and running in order to set up a CI/CD workflow. I then wanted to expand the app's functionality by allowing the user to input a custom shift number, instead of just a fixed ROT13 shift. To do so, I duplicated and modified the ROT13 shift function to test out a custom shift function. I finally managed to get this working but unfortunately, this means my JS script now has a lot of repeated code, which is inefficient and messy. I need to reorganise and streamline my code soon!

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please do let me know! â˜º
